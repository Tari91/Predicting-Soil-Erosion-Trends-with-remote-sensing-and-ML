🌍 **Soil Erosion Trend Prediction**
Leveraging Remote Sensing & Machine Learning for Environmental Intelligence

Overview
This solution delivers predictive insights into soil erosion trends by harnessing the power of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms. Designed for researchers, environmental analysts, and land use planners, it provides a streamlined workflow—from data ingestion to prediction and visualization.

Developed using Python and scikit-learn, this package offers a foundational model that can be scaled and integrated into operational Earth observation systems or decision-support tools.

🔧 **Features**

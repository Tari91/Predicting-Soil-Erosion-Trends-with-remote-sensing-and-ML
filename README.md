🌿 **Predicting Soil Erosion Trends with Synthetic Remote Sensing Data**
A Machine Learning Framework for Environmental Modeling & Research

🧭 Project Overview
This project delivers a high-fidelity simulation of soil erosion trends using synthetically generated environmental variables derived from remote sensing concepts. Built with Random Forest regression, this pipeline enables rapid prototyping, model validation, and educational exploration of geospatial ML workflows—all without requiring real-world data.

Whether you’re testing algorithms or building foundations for larger systems, this solution offers a streamlined, production-ready foundation for modeling soil degradation patterns.

✨ Key Capabilities
✅ End-to-end synthetic data simulation for NDVI, slope, rainfall, land cover, and elevation

🧠 Integrated Random Forest model for predicting soil loss

📈 Performance visualization: Actual vs Predicted scatter plot

📤 Export-ready output: Full dataset and predictions in a structured Excel workbook
